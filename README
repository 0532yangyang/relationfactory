QUICK START
===========
-----
export the paths (e.g. to your ~/.bashrc) (replace "path-to" with the path where you plan to check out the system):

export TAC_ROOT=/path-to/tac_kbp_system

-----
"generate" (prepare/install/...) the system: 
 
#> $TAC_ROOT/bin/generate_system.sh

-----

run the system on the 2011 data (replace "test-run" with a path NOT under $TAC_ROOT):

#> cd /test-run/
#> $TAC_ROOT/bin/run.sh $TAC_ROOT/evaluation/eval2011/queries_2012format.xml

NOTE: The whole system assumes all data to be in the latest (=2012) format.
Therefore, to run evaluations from previous years, converted queries have
to be used (marked by 2012format, or similar).


check the output file, '/test-run/response'. It should contain for each query 
some mixture of NIL answers and other answers, many of which score by 1.0, 
others with lower score.

Evaluate your run:

$TAC_ROOT/evaluation/bin/score.sh response $TAC_ROOT/evaluation/eval2011/key_2012format

Directories
===========

./bin           : top-level executables
./components    : components of the system
./config        : configuration files
./doc           : documents describing (previous versions of) the system
./evaluation    : evaluation scripts and data
./lib           : 3rd party software
./resources     : data used by the system (NE lists, index, etc)
./training      : training scripts

*/experimental directories are not yet part of the standard pipeline.

Each directory has an own README describing its contents.

How to change the pipeline
==========================

Change ./bin/makefile and insert a rule describing your new target.
